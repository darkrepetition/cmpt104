title: About me
---

I am an academic librarian in Edmonton, Alberta. 

I hold degrees in French Language and Literature, Humanities Computing (Digital Humanities), and Library and Information Studies. 

My research interests currently include digital literacy and pedagogy, materialist and land-based education, as well as theories of labour. 

Iâ€™m into weightlifting, dog sports, and exploring Edmonton trails. 

I have written on Medium in the past, and a book that I edited with my friend and colleague Mary Greenshields is being published with Library Juice Press. 

You can find my contact on the UofA Library Directory.
